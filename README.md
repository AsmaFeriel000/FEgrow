# FEgrow 2.0.0: Active Learning and acceleration 

A new release of FEgrow that adds active learning together with acceleration powered by Dask (multi -cpu, -node, -cluster).

To get started with the new functionality, see the [tutorials](https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/tree/master/tutorials) folder, which contains examples of i) basic interactive molecular design, ii) an introduction to the chemspace functionality, and iii) an example of active learning for inhibitor design.
